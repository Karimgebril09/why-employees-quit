In today's dynamic workplace landscape, understanding and anticipating factors influencing employee retention are crucial for organizational success. 
Through advanced analytics and machine learning, our project aims to unveil patterns and indicators contributing to turnover, providing valuable insights for proactive talent management and fostering a more resilient and engaged workforce.
Join us on this journey to harness the power of data to enhance employee retention strategies and optimize organizational performance.
    
The act of an employee quitting their job can have a negative impact on the workplace, reducing efficiency and productivity. This study aims to investigate the various factors that contribute to employees leaving their jobs. 
These factors can range from external reasons, such as a negative workplace environment that can lead to an employee feeling undervalued and unappreciated, to personal reasons, such as work-life imbalances or the desire to seek a different career path. 
Understanding these reasons is crucial for employers so that they can take appropriate measures to create a better workplace environment for their employees. To achieve this, we have gathered relevant data sets from Kaggle that contain information about employees. By studying these data sets, we aim to form a model that accurately predicts whether an employee is likely to quit or not.
